#### 2. Methodological information
The raw data comes from a BEP project. During the study, the participants were placed in a VR environment and asked to locate and gather 10 products from shelves in a specified order and place them in a cart. These products were shown on a shopping list. This experiment was done in 5 conditions:

- 0: Control condition: no external influence
- 1: Non-playable characters (NPCs): multiple NPCs were walking through the aisles, creating visual distractions.
- 2: Background noise: audio fragments of a busy supermarket were played, creating auditory distractions.
- 3: Arithmetic task: the participants had to perform an arithmetic task simultaneously with the primary task. 
- 4: Combined conditions: all previous conditions were combined.
